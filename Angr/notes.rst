- angr includes analyses to recover the control-flow graph of a binary program. This also includes recovery of function boundaries, as well as reasoning about indirect jumps and other useful metadata.


- Control Flow Graph

  - A basic analysis that one might carry out on a binary is a Control Flow Graph. A CFG is a graph with (conceptually) basic blocks as nodes and jumps/calls/rets/etc as edges.
