======================

This paper

- coverage-based fuzzing

- feedback-driven fuzzing mode

- genetic algorithm

AFL

- coveraged-based
- feedback-driven

Background
-------------

- static analysis

  - the analysis of programs that is performed without actually executing the programs
  - usually performed on the source code
  - by analysis on 
  
    - the lexical, grammar, semantics features, and data flow analysis, model checking

  - pros
  
    - detect hiding bugs
    
  - cons
  
    - high false rate
|

- dynamic analysis
- taint analysis
- symbolic execution
- fuzzing
