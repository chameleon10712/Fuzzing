Value Rendering Barrier
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

- Lack of **client-specific information**, such as subscription ID and resource group name.

- Lack of **domain-specific information**, for example, only "local" and "global" are valid location values, and a timeout value can only be a positive integer smaller than 3,600.

- Lack of **run-time dependent information**, such as the name of a resource dynamically created by a previous request.
