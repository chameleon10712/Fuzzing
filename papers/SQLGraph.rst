RDF
-----

W3C's Resource Description Framework, RDF, has been of great interest for networked data expression due in part to the popularity of the World Wide Web, and in part to its foundations in more traditional knowledge representation and reasoning systems. Among the attractive features of this language is the ability to distribute ontology development by basing terms in dereferencable, globally unambiguous identifiers. For this, RDF uses URIs whose scalability has been proven by the success of the web. This paper introduces a relational database/RDF gateway called Federate.
