RDF
-----

W3C's Resource Description Framework, RDF, has been of great interest for networked data expression due in part to the popularity of the World Wide Web, and in part to its foundations in more traditional knowledge representation and reasoning systems.

RDF


- Resource Description Framework
- RDF is a language for modeling data in binary relations. Relations are expressed in statements composed of a subject, object and a predicate (relationship) between them. These statements combine to form a directed, labeled graph (DLG).

Gremlin
---------

Gremlin is a graph traversal language and virtual machine developed by Apache TinkerPop of the Apache Software Foundation. Gremlin works for both OLTP-based graph databases as well as OLAP-based graph processors. Gremlin's automata and functional language foundation enable Gremlin to naturally support: imperative and declarative querying; host language agnosticism; user-defined domain specific languages; an extensible compiler/optimizer, single- and multi-machine execution models; hybrid depth- and breadth-first evaluation with Turing Completeness.
